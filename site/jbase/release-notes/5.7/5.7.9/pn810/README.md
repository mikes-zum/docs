## Notes

The default jBASE behavior is shared by UniVerse. The D3 behavior is shared by QM.

jBASE and UniVerse native behavior is to sum the lowest delimited values. So if an attribute has only multi-values it will sum them. But if one of those multi-values has more than one sub-value then it only sums the sub-values and leaves single value multi-values as their own total.
