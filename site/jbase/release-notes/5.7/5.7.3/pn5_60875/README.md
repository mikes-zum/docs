## Description

**READNEXT KEY** does not process all records in UniVerse or Prime emulations

### Previous Release Behavior

In UniVerse or Prime emulations, **READNEXT KEY** would not process the first index key value in an index.

For example, if the first index key value was **abc** and the second index key value was **def** and there were 10 of them then **READNEXT KEY** would skip all 10 **abc** values and begin at the **def** value.

### Current Release Behavior

All index key values are processed.
